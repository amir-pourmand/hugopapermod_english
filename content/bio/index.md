I am Amir Pourmand (امیر پورمند - in Farsi). Currently, I'm pursuing my master's degree in `AI & Robotics` at the Sharif University of Technology under the supervision of [Prof. Hamid R. Rabiee](http://sharif.edu/~rabiee/). As a member of `Digital Media Laboratory`, I'm working on "automatic, real-time polyp detection and classification using XAI".

I've studied computer engineering at [Yazd University](https://yazd.ac.ir/en). I've worked as a `software developer` in Amapardazesh company from 2016 to 2020 . That's why I know a lot about clean coding, software architectures, and excellent tools like git, which I use daily. 

Then, I got tired of coding as a software developer and I felt that It was somehow boring. So, I decided to pursue my master's degree to see what's going on in the world of AI. 

So, I studied! 

In Aug 2020, I was ranked **1st** among over 16,000 graduate applicants in the Iranian National University Entrance Exam for M.Sc. of Computer Engineering **in 7 (all CE) majors** (this rank is unprecedented in the history of CE University entrance exam) [(My Experiences)](https://aprd.ir/computer-engineering-masters-exam/). Afterward, In February 2021, I got **Silver Medal** in the 25th Scientific Olympiads for Iranian University Students [(My experiences)](https://aprd.ir/olympiad-computer-engineering/).

I prefer to use GNU-Linux OSes like Manjaro (Arch Linux)  or Kubuntu (KDE + Ubuntu) for my daily usage. I love [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), and this is the main reason I migrated from Windows to GNU-Linux. I'd love to call myself a `computer geek`.

I've also taken some MBTI tests and they have mostly categorized me into `Architect`([INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality)) or Logician ([INTP](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality)). I agree with both of them to some extent, and It seems to me that I am more `Architect`.  

However, I think Big-five personality test better describes me. [Here](https://bigfive-test.com/result/62fd4cb93c6f4e0009c810e1) is the result of my big-five test.
